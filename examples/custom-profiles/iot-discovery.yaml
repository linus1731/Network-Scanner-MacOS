description: Optimized for discovering IoT and smart home devices
concurrency: 64              # Moderate concurrency (IoT devices can be slow)
timeout: 2.5                 # Patient timeout for slow IoT devices
port_range: top1000          # Many IoT devices use non-standard ports
rate_limit: 150              # Gentle rate limit (IoT devices may be fragile)
random_delay: true           # Spread out to avoid overwhelming devices
min_delay: 0.02              # Small delays
max_delay: 0.1               # 100ms max delay
